This application shows the most frequently committed crimes by
professional NFL players, sorted by the position they play.

This example was chosen because an API for NFL crime data was freely
available, did not require an API key to use, and required multiple
queries of the API in order to retrieve these data.

Please see the code for comments about how the code was written.

    printQA('Give a few reasons why separating state is useful.', `
There are a number of useful effects of separating state:
  * the developer can continue to reason about the code as it
    grows by modularising or categorising it;
  * coding tasks can be split across domains and teams;
  * testing is more effective as code can be tested in units.
    `);

    printQA('Are there any benefits to using ES6 classes and, if so, what are they?', `
The benefit of using ES6 classes is largely that they provide a
syntactic sugar that makes classes much more accessible to those
who are new to Javascript, especially those coming from other
languages, to whom traditional Javascript classes (also known as
constructor functions) are quite confusing.

They also enable programmers to replace some boilerplate code
with keywords like 'extends' and 'super'.
    `);

    printQA('What is immutability? How can this be useful', `
Immutability is a language feature that prevents a variable from
being mutated.  For statically typed languages, this is usually
a compiler feature.  For Javascript the rules vary depending on
the method used.

For const, a variable is made immutability effectively at compile
time, when the variable is first declared.  Other variables can
be made immutable at some time after initialisation has taken
place using Object.freeze,

Immutability can help protect a developer from modifying state
that should be left alone. In a language like Javascript,
which enables variable shadowing, it is easy to accidentally
mutate a variable. If it is made immutable, the app will throw
an error, either during the compilation phase or during runtime
depening on the object.
    `);

    printQA('What is the spread operator for?', `
It is syntactic sugar for Object.assign, which is a function for
taking a set of properties from one object and assigning them
to another, using the same keys.
    `);
});
